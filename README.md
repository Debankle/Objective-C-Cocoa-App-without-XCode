# Objective-C-Cocoa-App-without-XCode
This is a basic Cocoa gui application, created completely programatically, and can be used as a template to build from.

To use this, clone the repo or download it as a zip, and build the program with
```
make
```

Once it is build, run it in the same directory as the Info.plist or it won't work. Good luck, and I hope this helps someone.

## Purpose
~~Once upon a time, I was having trouble with this, and recently came back to the idea. I am not a fan of IDE's as it feels like cheating, so this works better for me. I hope someone else who is looking into this finds it helpful. :)~~

Holy cringe from child me. IDE's are awesome. Still hope this helped someone's curiosity.
